# dualization
Implementation in c++ of algorithms for solving the dualization problem for positive Boolean functions

# Description
The code provided is the implementation af some algorithms for the decision version of the dualization problem for positive Boolean function. There are tree classes: "bipartite_graph" used to deal with the bipartite representation of a hypergraph. In this class are implemented the algorithm:
* count_

# Dependencies
The GMP libreries are used for arbitrary aritmetic precision. The header "json.hpp2 is used for dealing with JSON file format.

# Usage
Run "experiment_prod_ver1.5" to execute some algorithms on some hypergraphs.
Run "generate_hypergraph_ver1.0" to randomly generate and save hypergraphs.
